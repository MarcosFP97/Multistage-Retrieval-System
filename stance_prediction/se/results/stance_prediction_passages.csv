Overview of Posterior Tibial Tendonitis


  Peroneal Tendonitis (Outer Side of Ankle)  

The tendons of the peroneal muscles wrap around the outside (little toe side) of the ankle. With peroneal tendonitis, pain and possibly swelling happen around the outer ankle and just below and above it. Or it will be painful at the styloid process of the 5th metatarsal, along the pinky toe side between the toe and the ankle where the tendon inserts into the bone. If you have high-arched feet and a history of ankle sprains, you may be at risk for this type of tendonitis. Peroneal Tendon Tears

Sponge Bath for a Child's Fever


Topic OverviewA sponge bath may be given if: 
Your child's fever is 104°F (40°C) or higher and
Acetaminophen or ibuprofen has not lowered the temperature and
Your child is very uncomfortable. Give your child an appropriate dose of acetaminophen or ibuprofen before giving him or her a sponge bath. Wait 30 minutes to see whether the medicine brings the child's fever below 104°F (40°C). Acetaminophen can be found in many forms and comes in different doses. Be safe with medicines. Read and follow all instructions on the label."

Your child is known to be allergic to, or is unable to tolerate, antipyretic (anti-fever) drugs (a rare case). It is advisable to combine sponging with acetaminophen or ibuprofen if:
Fever is making your child extremely uncomfortable. He is vomiting and may not be able to keep the medication in his stomach. To sponge your child, place him in his regular bath (tub or baby bath), but put only 1 to 2 inches of tepid water (85–90 degrees Fahrenheit, or 29.4–32.2 degrees Celsius) in the basin. If you do not have a bath thermometer, test the water with the back of your hand or wrist. It should feel just slightly warm."

Light clothing
When you want to break a fever, it’s also a good idea to dress in light clothing, as lighter clothing can have a cooling effect.10 It’s been reported that very warm clothing may increase a child’s body temperature even in the case that they are not ill.11
Tepid sponging
Placing a cool, damp washcloth on your forehead and the back of your neck can help your fever symptoms feel better. You might also want to give yourself a sponge bath with cool water, focusing on high-heat areas like your armpits and groin. Normally, this method, known as tepid sponging, is done for about 5 minutes. Like staying in a cool environment and wearing light clothing, this physical measure for reducing a fever may not be as effective as fever-reducing medications.12,13Over-the-Counter Medicines that Reduce FeverA fever is not a pleasant symptom to experience.

Should I give my child a sponge bath or a drawn bath to lower her fever? (ages 5 to 8)

Not usually. If your child has a temperature under 103 degrees F and is eating and acting okay, you don't need to do anything to bring his fever down. In fact, because a fever can help your child fight an infection, it's a good idea to let it run its course.Of course, as your child's temperature climbs, it can make you nervous (especially if he's had a febrile seizure before) and him uncomfortable. If your child is really uncomfortable (so that he can't sleep, for example) and his fever is 103 degrees or higher, then I'd suggest you give him the appropriate dose of acetaminophen or ibuprofen to bring his fever down so that he — and you — can rest.If fever-reducing medication isn't a good option for your child — because he's allergic to the medicine or doesn't take medicine very well, or you'd rather not give him any — a lukewarm bath or sponge bath won't hurt him, and it may help reduce his temperature."

IntroductionCurrently, dementia is a substantial public health concern due to the exponentially increasing number of older adults. Developing novel strategies to protect cognition in the elderly population is critical for managing the disease burden and cost of care1. The pathogenesis and progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (the first cause of dementia) are associated with various inflammatory processes2,3. Indeed, inflammatory processes play at least some role in the pathology of AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI)4, which represents an intermediate state between normal cognitive aging and dementia."

There is some evidence that suggests elderly people who take in larger amounts of folic acid than recommended can decrease their chances of developing Alzheimer’s. In some studies, consumption of folic acid improved scores on memory tests, however on other tests no positive or adverse effects were provided when increased levels of folic acid intake. While more tests are need to fully determine the effects of folic acid on cognitive function some clinical trials are yielding positive results. Some of these results include:

Improved memory
Better change in cognitive function
Significant difference in information processing 
Change in age-related cognitive issues
Improved mental function in older people

Researchers are learning how the biochemical processes of food intake and digestion interact with changes in the brain. They are finding that the gut microbiome — the community of viruses, bacteria and other microbes in the digestive system — may influence the onset and progression of Alzheimer’s disease. Studies in mice and humans show that the composition of the gut microbiome in Alzheimer’s and mild cognitive impairment is different from that in cognitively normal beings."

Nearly a half million people seek treatment for burns every year, and many more deal with mild burns at home. Burn injuries are classified with degrees: first-degree burns affect just the top layer of skin (epidermis), second-degree burns reach the dermis layer in the middle, and third-degree burns affect the full thickness of skin, down to the layer of fat underneath the dermis. Tips for treating burn injuries
Without proper treatment, even superficial burns can deepen, making healing more difficult. Gibson shares the following tips for treating burn injuries:

It can help soothe some initial pain, but in the end it will slow the healing process.ImageCredit...Leif ParsonsThat has been borne out over the years in various studies of simple treatments for minor scalds and sunburns. In one randomized study by Danish researchers in 2002, 24 healthy volunteers were inflicted with first-degree burns and subjected to different treatments. Those who received a cooling treatment similar to ice did not experience reduced pain or inflammation compared with those who received a placebo treatment. In another study in the journal Burns in 1997, another team of scientists compared easing burns with ice cubes for 10 minutes with other remedies and found that ice caused “the most severe damage.” “Using an ice cube immediately after injury,” the authors added, “is harmful in some instances.”According to the Mayo Clinic, putting ice on a burn can cause frostbite and damage the skin."

So some believe that taking antioxidants should help the disease, and many dermatologists recommend this for their patients. However it is important to remember that no matter how much things seem to make sense, we can’t know for sure if this approach will help vitiligo until they’re tested in clinical trials.

Early treatment options include the following:Phototherapy, a medical procedure in which your skin is carefully exposed to limited amounts of ultraviolet light. Phototherapy may be given alone, or after you take a drug that makes your skin sensitive to light. A dermatologist performs this treatment.Certain lasers may help the skin repigment.Medicines applied to the skin, such as corticosteroid creams or ointments, immunosuppressant creams or ointments such as pimecrolimus (Elidel) and tacrolimus (Protopic), or topical drugs such as methoxsalen (Oxsoralen) may also help.Skin may be moved (grafted) from normally pigmented areas and placed onto areas where there is pigment loss.Several cover-up makeups or skin dyes can mask vitiligo. Ask your provider for the names of these products.In extreme cases when most of the body is affected, the remaining skin that still has pigment may be depigmented, or bleached."

The authors of this review investigated the effects of yoga on patients with asthma.This review included 15 randomized controlled trials with 1,048 participants.1 Yoga improved quality of life by a mean 0.57 units on each item of the seven-point scale on the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (95% CI, 0.37 to 0.77), in which a 0.5-unit change is considered significant. Yoga also improved asthma symptoms (standardized mean difference = 0.37; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.65), although there is no defined minimal clinically important difference for the scale used to assess this. Yoga also reduced medication use (RR = 5.35; 95% CI, 1.29 to 22.11); however, the medications assessed varied among studies, and two studies that were not included in the review demonstrated no differences in medication use.Yoga had a mixed effect on spirometry parameters."

During an asthma attack, the airways become narrowed and inflamed. The muscles surrounding them tighten and squeeze, resulting in symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, and chest tightness.Treatment for asthma usually involves taking medication, which relaxes the muscles around the airways and reduces swelling and mucus.Some research shows that yoga may be useful as a complementary treatment for asthma. This means that a person would perform it in addition to an existing treatment plan, likely involving medication.A 2016 review of clinical trials involving 1,048 participants found that yoga somewhat improves quality of life and symptoms in people with asthma. However, researchers noted that many of the studies were flawed."

Meditation can be part of yoga, a spiritual system with engrained practices such as holding specific body positions and breathing. The effect of yoga and meditation on asthma is hypothesised to come from the retraining that occurs with the breathing and movement patterns, thus enabling an improvement in tidal volume, breathing rates and muscle relaxation [62].In a recent systematic review of four RCTs, meditation has been found to improve some asthma outcomes [63]. The studies were 8 weeks to 3 months long, with the majority of studies requiring ∼20 min daily meditation practice. Quality of life was measured in two studies, which indicated a significant improvement compared to the control group. All four studies reported lung function; however, there was no significant effect between groups."

Maxims typically date back many years, but “feed a cold, starve a fever” may beat them all. This saying has been traced to a 1574 dictionary by John Withals, which noted that “fasting is a great remedy of fever.” The belief is that eating food may help the body generate warmth during a “cold” and that avoiding food may help it cool down when overheated. But recent medical science says the old saw is wrong. It should be “feed a cold, feed a fever.”

Let’s take colds first."

Eating food when you have a cold can also help the body generate heat, although other methods of keeping warm, like wearing an extra layer of clothes or wrapping yourself in a blanket, do the trick as well. There are many reasons you shouldn’t try to starve a fever. Fever is part of the immune system’s attempt to combat the virus. Fever raises body temperature, which increases metabolism and burns more calories. That’s one reason why taking in calories becomes important."

 Cold & FluShould You Feed a Cold and Starve a Fever?Learn the latest wisdom about what to eat when you have a cold or a fever.By Linda MeloneMedically Reviewed by Justin Laube, MDReviewed: June 25, 2020Medically ReviewedFighting an illness requires lots of energy, so eating nutritious foods — especially soup, which also keeps you hydrated — helps combat both colds and fevers.iStockThe popular advice to ""feed a cold, starve a fever"" is probably something you’ve heard time and again when nursing a cold or the flu. But is it advice you should heed?The answer is no. In actuality, you should feed both a cold and a fever — and starve neither, says Mark A. Moyad, MD, MPH, Jenkins/Pokempner director of preventive and alternative medicine at the University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor.“When you have a cold or a fever, your immune system is fighting off an infection, and eating less during the early stages of an infection can actually be dangerous,” he explains. “The body requires large amounts of energy to create and assemble the large number of immune cells necessary to fight the enemy. Good nutrition and calories provide this energy."

The first thing to note is that fever itself is not actually an illness, while a cold is. Colds are caused by viruses and may result in a number of unpleasant symptoms – including a stuffy nose, coughing, sore throat and, very occasionally, fever.1 A fever, however, can be a symptom of a cold, the flu or any kind of bacterial or viral infection.2,3
 
Colds and the Flu Need Fluids to Help Treat Them
One of the most important steps in helping to treat cold and flu symptoms, including fever, is to keep up your fluid intake to help prevent dehydration.1,4 This can be done by drinking water or other liquids, such as tea, broth or soup.4,5
And because your body needs fluids to support its recovery, ‘starving’ it of this essential hydration will do little to help treat the cause of your fever – and instead may even keep you from feeling better.5
 
Nutritious Foods Can Help to Support Your Immune System
Another reason not to act on the ‘feed a cold, starve a fever’ myth when you’re feeling ill is that certain foods can actually help to support our immune systems. A healthy and strong immune system can help to protect you from cold and flu viruses in the first place.6
Vitamin C is vital for immune function – as well as bone structure, iron absorption and healthy skin. But since our bodies don’t produce vitamin C naturally, we have to get it from either our diet or vitamin supplements. This important vitamin is found in many healthy foods – including citrus fruits, strawberries, green vegetables and tomatoes.7
A nutritious diet that is high in fruits and vegetables is also one of the easiest ways to help support your immune system and general health – whether you have a cold, fever or neither – so it isn’t wise to starve your body of these foods at any time.8
















This important vitamin is found in many healthy foods – including citrus fruits, strawberries, green vegetables and tomatoes.7









Feeding Colds and Fever – Listen to Your Body 
Ultimately, if you are suffering from a cold or a fever, it’s important to listen to your body when it comes to food.3
Since our immune systems do need nutrients, it’s a good idea to keep up some calorie intake when you’re not feeling well – if you have the appetite."

When you eat a nutritional, well-balanced diet, many other factors fall in place that keep your body functioning optimally.It’s true that the fever distinction is useless. Both bacteria and viruses can give us fevers. And the holistic benefits of a well-balanced diet are tough to overstate."

Red indicates vaccine antigens.Scientists at Emory Vaccine Center have found a link between immunity induced by vaccination and an ancient way that cells adapt to scarcity, a link that could help researchers develop vaccines against challenging infections such as HIV or malaria.Researchers studying immune responses to the yellow fever vaccine – one of the most effective in history -- identified a gene whose activation in key immune cells is a sign of a robust response. The gene, called GCN2, encodes a protein involved in sensing amino acid starvation and regulates the process of autophagy, a response to starvation or stress within cells.The results, published online Thursday by the journal Science,  shows that GCN2 is critical for the induction of immunity to the yellow fever vaccine, and suggest that vaccine additives (called adjuvants) that are effective in stimulating GCN2 and autophagy would be especially potent in stimulating long-lasting immunity. ""This reveals an unappreciated link between the ancient starvation response and vaccine-induced immunity, and highlights the power of system-wide approaches in revealing new insights,"" says senior author Bali Pulendran, PhD. ""We were not thinking about the stress response pathway and immunity until our analysis pointed us in that direction."

When it comes to cancer, can selenium supplements help? Past research on the topic has had conflicting results, while recent research suggests that they may do more harm than good. (2)
What the research tells us
In the past, studies showed that taking selenium as a supplement helped prevent people from getting cancer. However, a more recent systematic review suggests that this might not be true. This review looked at many different types of cancer – including head and neck, esophageal, colorectal, liver, skin, lung, breast, bladder, prostate, and blood cancer – and found no evidence that selenium supplements reduced cancer risk. Selenium supplements were also associated with side effects such as an upset stomach."

In addition, the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) failed to find protective effects against prostate cancer (8) (21) or colorectal adenomas (45). In other studies, selenium along with soy and vitamin E did not prevent prostate cancer progression (27), and selenium taken with lycopene did not modulate prostate cancer risk (46). Moreover, selenium levels may influence the risk of aggressive prostate cancer (22), and supplementation may increase prostate cancer mortality (37). A chemoprevention trial of selenium in patients with non-small cell lung cancer did not show benefit, but did suggest a possible nonsignificant increase in secondary lung cancers (25)."

The authors found no association between selenium intake and risk of breast cancer. A meta-analysis of 20 epidemiologic studies showed a potential inverse association between toenail, serum, and plasma selenium levels and prostate cancer risk [38].

Get enough zincZinc is an essential mineral found in high amounts in animal foods, such as meat, fish, eggs, and shellfish.Getting enough zinc is one of the cornerstones of male fertility.Observational studies show that low zinc status or deficiency is associated with low testosterone levels, poor sperm quality, and an increased risk of male infertility (38).Also, taking zinc supplements increases testosterone levels and sperm count in those who are low in zinc (39, 40, 41).Furthermore, zinc supplements may reduce the decreased testosterone levels that are associated with excessive amounts of high-intensity exercise (12, 13).Controlled trials need to confirm these observational findings.9. Consider ashwagandhaAshwagandha (Withania somnifera) is a medicinal herb that’s been used in India since ancient times.Studies suggest that ashwagandha may improve male fertility by boosting testosterone levels.One study in men with low sperm cell counts showed that taking 675 mg of ashwagandha root extract per day for 3 months significantly improved fertility.Specifically, it increased sperm counts by 167%, semen volume by 53%, and sperm motility by 57%, compared with levels at the start of the study. In comparison, minimal improvements were detected among those who got a placebo treatment (42).Increased testosterone levels may be partly responsible for these benefits.A study in 57 young men following a strength-training program showed that consuming 600 mg of ashwagandha root extract daily significantly increased testosterone levels, muscle mass, and strength, compared with a placebo (43).These findings are supported by observational evidence indicating that ashwagandha supplements may improve sperm counts, sperm motility, antioxidant status, and testosterone levels (44, 45).10. Eat maca rootTaking maca root supplements may improve libido, as well as fertility and sexual performance."

Further research is needed before the oil can be recommended.Evening primrose oil for other conditionsHerbal remedies tend to be associated with numerous health claims because the regulation of these products is less rigorous than for prescription drugs.Many conditions are said to be eased by evening primrose oil. The following lack any supporting evidence:asthmaADHDhepatitis Bhigh cholesterolliver cancerbreast painobesitypsoriasispsoriatic arthritisThe following conditions have “insufficient evidence” to support evening primrose oil as a treatment: chronic fatigue syndrome, diaper rash, dry eyes, dyslexia, dyspraxia, ichthyosis, infant development, pregnancy complications, rheumatoid arthritis, schizophrenia, Sjogren’s syndrome, ulcerative colitis, cancer, acne, multiple sclerosis, heart disease, and Alzheimer’s disease.RegulationIn Britain, evening primrose oil used to be approved for treating eczema and breast pain. However, in 2002, the drug regulator concluded there was not enough evidence of the effectiveness of evening primrose for these uses.SafetyShare on PinterestDue to its blood thinning effect, evening primrose oil is not suitable for patients using aspirin or other blood thinning medications.There are some potential dangers to EPO:It is possible to be allergic to EPO or its forms. The FDA does not monitor supplements and care should be given to choosing a brand that is know for purity, accuracy of dose, and quality.Drug interactions bleedingThere is a blood-thinning effect with evening primrose oil, so there is a higher risk of bleeding for people taking the blood thinner warfarin. Therefore, these patients should not use the oil.Other drugs that thin the blood may also be a problem taken alongside the oil, including clopidogrel and aspirin.SeizuresPeople with epilepsy or other seizure disorder should avoid taking evening primrose oil as it may increase the chances of having a seizure."

Can I Use Vitamin E Oil for Scars? HealthlineHealth ConditionsDiscoverPlanConnectSubscribeSkinSelf Care TipsNutritionSkin Care GuideDry Skin RemediesAcne 101Eczema TypesPsoriasis BasicsCan I Use Vitamin E Oil for Scars?Medically reviewed by Cynthia Cobb, DNP, APRN, WHNP-BC, FAANP — Written by Brian Krans —  Updated on September 28, 2018ResearchSupplementsWhere to get it OverviewThere’s a popular belief that rubbing vitamin E oil onto your acne scars can help them heal, and reduce their visibility. Ointments and creams that contain vitamin E claim to clear every type of scar can be found on store shelves across America.However, evidence that vitamin E has this effect is mostly anecdotal. There’s little clinical evidence to support any of these claims.Find out the truth about the many health claims for caprylic acid. Healing scarsOne study found that vitamin E and Aquaphor ointments were no different in healing 90 percent of scars in people who had recently had patches of skin cancer removed. And one-third of the participants who used vitamin E developed a red, itchy rash called contact dermatitis.However, a different study found that children with surgical scars who used vitamin E three times a day didn’t develop keloids, or extra scar tissue over the wound."
Can applying vitamin E cream remove skin scars?,4,https://www.abc.net.au/news/health/2016-09-02/does-vitamin-e-improve-scars/7537890,0.642608384291331,0.619900643825531,-0.00598780112341,"One of the most popular is vitamin E, which is found in many skin creams. But will vitamin E really help to improve your scar?According to Sydney dermatologist Dr Phillip Artemi, the answer is no.He says despite the marketing hype, research has clearly shown vitamin E has absolutely no beneficial effect on scars. ""People put a vitamin E cream on, [and over time] notice the improvement, and quite incorrectly, think, 'Oh it's this stuff I'm putting on' — but it's not,"" Dr Artemi said.As your body forms a scar there is a natural process of slow and gradual improvement over a period of about 12 months.And this will happen regardless of whether vitamin E cream is applied. It is true that collagen, a fibrous protein in the skin, is involved in scar formation and that vitamin E, when present in the body, influences the formation and arrangement of collagen fibres.But Dr Artemi says it does not automatically follow that applying vitamin E to skin will improve the way collagen is formed and laid down when wounds heal and scars form.In fact several studies have tested this exact idea and shown it to be false. One study even found that in almost a third of cases, vitamin E caused a common skin irritation — known as contact dermatitis.Dermatologists now consider it ""a proven scientific fact"" that applying vitamin E is of no value to scars, Dr Artemi says.Don't waste money on unproven remediesSo if vitamin E will not help scars, is there anything that will?The notion that aloe vera, lemon juice, and other over-the-counter oils and creams will fade or shrink scars is also ""nonsense"", Dr Artemi says.For example, while initial tests on rabbits and in the laboratory suggested onion extract might be beneficial for scars, further studies in humans showed it did not live up to the promise. ""People are making a lot of money selling products that do nothing for scars,"" Dr Artemi said.However using a dressing to trap moisture over a wound when it's healing can help minimise scarring and provide the best possible cosmetic outcome.Scar treatments explainedChemical reconstruction of skin scars: A chemical (usually trichloroacetic acid) is used to frost the scar, in order for the body to produce new collagen fibres during the healing process.Dermal fillers: Chemical fillers are injected into the skin to decrease the depth of scars.Fractional laser: A non-wounding laser is used to stimulate collagen growth and tighten skin.Micro-needling:  Small needles are delivered into the dermal layers of the skin, to break down scar tissue and stimulate the formation of new collagen."

It could therefore not be determined if oral magnesium was superior to placebo in preventing frequent migraines in children and adolescents.While oral magnesium is generally well tolerated, the most prominent side-effect is diarrhoea. Magnesium toxicity leads to loss of deep tendon reflexes as well as generalized muscle weakness. Severe toxicity can manifest as cardiac muscle weakness, respiratory paralysis and death, and patients with renal disease are at greater risk for developing toxicity.

One potential remedy is magnesium.Magnesium is a natural mineral that helps keep blood pressure stable, promotes heart health, regulates nerve and muscle function, and builds bone, DNA, and protein. A lack of magnesium may also contribute to headaches and migraines.Some people use magnesium to treat and prevent migraine symptoms, including a severe headache, visual disturbances, sensitivity to light and sound, and nausea and vomiting.Does magnesium help get rid of migraines?Share on PinterestStudies suggest that magnesium may help prevent headaches.Some research has indicated that taking a magnesium supplement could be an effective way to prevent headaches."

Calcium and magnesium, which are involved in the synthesis and release of various neurotransmitters and inflammatory mediators, may work together to help the nervous system function properly and relieve nerve tension (10, 11). Our results support the positive role of magnesium and calcium in migraine, the only difference being that we did not find an effect of magnesium on migraine in men. We speculate that this might be due to significantly higher ionized magnesium levels in the muscles of men than in women (45). Therefore, the effect of dietary magnesium intake on actual magnesium levels may be attenuated in men. Further prospective longitudinal studies and mechanistic studies are needed to elucidate the association between dietary calcium and magnesium intake and migraine."

This mineral, which is found in the body and in many foods, especially high-fiber ones, works by activating enzymes in the body and is crucial to nerve transmission and other important functions. People with migraines may have lower levels of magnesium than those who don't have migraines, which is why it may be effective. The best evidence comes from a 1996 study in Cephalalgia of 81 patients who were given either 600 mg of magnesium or a placebo every day for 12 weeks. In the magnesium group, the frequency of attacks was reduced by 41.6 percent during weeks 9 through 12 and by 15.8 percent in the placebo group.

Also be aware that if your healthcare provider does give the OK for magnesium supplementation, he or she will likely recommend a pediatric (child-safe) dose. A Word From Verywell  

If you have been recently diagnosed with migraines, it is reasonable to discuss a magnesium deficiency with your healthcare provider, especially since taking a magnesium supplement or choosing to eat magnesium-rich foods is well tolerated, inexpensive, and easy.

Not every clinical trial has shown magnesium to be effective at preventing migraine headaches, but there’s enough evidence that it helps that it’s a good option to consider.How can it help? Experts think magnesium may help prevent the wave of brain signaling, called a cortical spreading depression, that is thought to cause migraine. It can also reduce pain during an attack by blocking pain-transmitting chemicals in the brain.Research suggests that it’s especially helpful for people who have migraine with aura or menstrual migraine. Scientists believe it may help prevent aura by stopping your brain from producing the signals that cause it, but they aren’t quite sure why it’s so effective against menstrual migraine.What other conditions can magnesium help with?Magnesium isn’t just beneficial for migraine sufferers.

This is akin to giving cyanocobalamine in a blinded fashion to a group of people with peripheral neuropathy without regard to their cyanocobalamine levels. Both oral and intravenous magnesium are widely available, extremely safe, very inexpensive and for patients who are magnesium deficient can be highly effective. Considering these features of magnesium, the fact that magnesium deficiency may be present in up to half of migraine patients, and that routine blood tests are not indicative of magnesium status, empiric treatment with at least oral magnesium is warranted in all migraine sufferers. © Springer-Verlag 2011

    The importance of exercise when you have diabetes



February 3, 2021



For people who have diabetes—or almost any other disease, for that matter—the benefits of exercise can't be overstated. Exercise helps control weight, lower blood pressure, lower harmful LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, raise healthy HDL cholesterol, strengthen muscles and bones, reduce anxiety, and improve your general well-being. There are added benefits for people with diabetes: exercise lowers blood glucose levels and boosts your body's sensitivity to insulin, countering insulin resistance. Many studies underscore these and other benefits from exercise. Following are some highlights of those results:

Exercise lowered HbA1c values by 0.7 percentage point in people of different ethnic groups with diabetes who were taking different medications and following a variety of diets—and this improvement occurred even though they didn't lose any weight. All forms of exercise—aerobic, resistance, or doing both (combined training)—were equally good at lowering HbA1c values in people with diabetes."

Physical activity is very important for people with diabetes! Good news – it’s not as hard as you might think to be more active. Being More Active Is Better for You
If you have diabetes, being active makes your body more sensitive to insulin (the hormone that allows cells in your body to use blood sugar for energy), which helps manage your diabetes. Physical activity also helps control blood sugar levels and lowers your risk of heart disease and nerve damage. Being physically active can be fun. When it’s possible, go outside with a friend, connect, and enjoy the weather."

They had improvements in health-related (SF-36 physical component scores) quality of life (QOL) and depression symptoms after 12 months that were mediated by enhanced physical fitness (280).However, it seems that individuals who undertake exercise to prevent a chronic disease fare better than those who undertake it to manage an existing one. A recent meta-analysis found that while psychological well-being was significantly improved among individuals who exercised for disease prevention, it deteriorated significantly when undertaken for management of CVD, end-stage renal disease, pulmonary disease, neurological disorders, and cancer (90). These findings suggest that benefits may vary, with those with fewer existing complications benefiting the most.Meta-analyses of clinically depressed men and women of all age-groups found substantial decreases in depressive symptoms after both short and long courses of exercise (50) and clinical depression and depressive symptoms among the aged (243).

Fermented milk for hypertension 

High blood pressure is a major health problem as it is one of the main risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Fermented milk has been suggested to reduce blood pressure in humans. This review was conducted to establish whether the intake of fermented milk lowers blood pressure in humans. In 15 studies including 1232 participants a very modest lowering of systolic blood pressure was found, but no effect on diastolic blood pressure was present. The included studies were of a variable quality and the findings do not support the use of fermented milk as antihypertensive treatment or as a lifestyle intervention to reduce blood pressure. Authors' conclusions: 

The review does not support an effect of fermented milk on blood pressure."

However, healthy bacteria and organic proteins present in certain fermented milks could control this microbiota and therefore help to reduce high blood pressure. “New evidence suggests that antihypertensive fermented milks, including probiotics, bioactive peptides, and exopolysaccharides obtained from milk fermented with specific lactic acid bacteria, may modulate gut microbiota,” Dr. Vallejo-Córdoba reports. “Therefore, there is potential for the development of tailor-made fermented milks with gut microbiota modulation and blood pressure-lowering effects.”
The researchers say they will need to perform more studies to understand the antihypertensive effects of fermented milks. High blood pressure is a risk factor for developing cardiovascular disease and is one of the leading causes of death globally. Healthy gut bacteria influences intestinal development, barrier integrity and function, body metabolism, the immune system, and the central nervous system."

Finland has one of the highest rates of hypertension in Europe, 
despite a long-term public health and information campaign. Following pre-market clinical trials, Valio's Evolus, a modern 
spin on a traditional Scandinavian fermented milk drink, with added 
juice, was launched to the market in November 2000 bearing a 
blood-pressure lowering health claim. Sales in the first few months 
exceeded expectations, and it has since been launched in other 
European countries.The new study, published in the December issue of the 
American Journal of Hypertension​, used a specially 
formulated version of the drink which is currently not available on 
the market, containing ten times the concentration of tripeptides, 
the protein fragments into which the milk protein is broken down 
when the Lactobacillus is added. The concentration of 
isoleucine-proline-proline was 7.5mg/100g, and 
valine-proline-proline 10mg/100g).It involved 94 people with high blood pressure, who were not 
receiving any drugs for their condition. After a four-week run-in 
period they were given either 150ml of the fermented milk drink 
twice a day for ten weeks, or a control product.The participants' 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurement 
was taken at the start and end of the intervention period.The L helveticus​ group was seen to have an average 
systolic blood pressure about four points lower than the control 
group at the end of the study, and diastolic blood pressure about 
two points lower, and no adverse effects were reported.Lowering systolic blood pressure by three points is understood 
to reduce the risk of stroke by between ten and 13 percent.The researchers concluded that the drink, when used daily, 
""does have a BP-lowering effect in hypertensive subjects""​. They said that it therefore has potential as a dietary means of 
controlling hypertension.These tripeptides have previously been shown to reduce blood 
pressure in animals, and to lower blood pressure in people with 
mild hypertension."

This, it turns out, could also keep cardiovascular problems at bay.Kefir is a milk-based drink made by adding kefir grains — whitish grains obtained through the fermentation of specific bacteria and yeast — that allow it to obtain the specific creamy thickness and slightly sour taste.This probiotic drink has traditionally been tied to numerous benefits — especially its wholesome effects on the gut microbiome and digestion.But now we know that the bacteria in our guts influence more than just a good digestion.The microorganisms that populate our guts have been shown to communicate with the brain, which gives them the potential to influence plenty of processes in our body.A study from last year even showed that people with coronary heart disease exhibited differences in the composition of their gut microbiota, compared with people without this condition.Probiotics to the rescue?Another paper, this one published in the journal Nature, noted that a well-balanced gut microbiome could protect against high blood pressure, though the underlying biological mechanisms through which it is able to accomplish this remained unclear.Yet this discovery led the study’s authors to hypothesize that we could wield probiotic supplements as a weapon against hypertension, as they would promote healthful bacterial diversity.“I think,” said one of the scientists, “certainly there’s some promise in developing probiotics that could be targeted to possibly fixing some of the effects of a high-salt diet [responsible for high blood pressure].”However, researchers at Auburn University in Alabama and the University of Vila Velha in Espirito Santo, Brazil, are taking the question closer to home.In a recent study, they worked with a rat model to see whether kefir’s probiotic properties would influence gut health and help to lower blood pressure.Their findings were presented earlier this week at the annual Experimental Biology conference, held in San Diego, CA.From gut to brain to cardiovascular systemIn order to see whether, and how, a diet that consistently integrated kefir would influence blood pressure, the team — which was led by Mirian Silva-Cutini, of Auburn University — worked with three different groups of rats:Those in the first group had high blood pressure, and they were given kefir on a regular basis for a period of 9 weeks.Those in the second group also had high blood pressure, but they were not given kefir.Those in the third group had no blood pressure problems, and they were not given kefir (the controls).After the 9-week period, stool and blood samples were taken taken from all the rats in order to establish which changes had — or had not — occurred in their gut microbiota, and to test for specific toxins that might be released by some bacteria.Blood pressure was also measured, and the team used “immunofluorescence” to look at patterns of neural changes in the hypothalamus. This region of the brain plays an important role in regulating some basic processes in the body, including blood pressure.Silva-Cutini and colleagues discovered that the rats who had regularly been consuming kefir for 9 weeks exhibited lower levels of endotoxins, which are harmful substances that are a byproduct of bacterial disintegration. Endotoxins are known to contribute to inflammation.The same rats also presented lower blood pressure and had an improved intestinal structure, as the permeability — that is, how easily various microbes and substances can leak into the system — of the intestines was lowered.Another finding was that kefir-drinking rats had regained the balance of helpful bacteria in the gut microbiota, and the level of inflammation in their central nervous systems was reduced.The results indicate that kefir’s effect on gut bacteria is reflected in the kinds of signals transmitted by the brain to the rest of the system. Thus, a balanced gut microbiome appears to influence the brain to lower blood pressure to healthy levels.“Our data suggests that kefir antihypertensive-associated mechanisms involve gut microbiota-brain axis communication during hypertension,” the researchers conclude.HypertensionCardiovascular / CardiologyInfectious Diseases / Bacteria / VirusesNutrition / DietWritten by Maria Cohut, Ph.D. on April 27, 2018 — Fact checked by Jasmin CollierLatest newsWhen are we really dead?

Can Dupixent cure eczema? Can Dupixent cure eczema? Medically reviewed by Carmen Fookes, BPharm. Last updated on Nov 12, 2021. Official Answer
by Drugs.com



Dupixent (dupilumab) is not a cure for eczema; however, it does effectively reduce symptoms in the majority of people prescribed it, such as:

Itching
The appearance of the rash
The frequency of AD flares."
Can dupixent treat eczema?,7,https://nationaleczema.org/dupixent-feedback/,0.369274543287853,0.293606869876385,-0.024164788424969,"The drug performed well in clinical trials, but the eczema community has been waiting to see whether it would do so in the real world. Carol Greenspun
In the two-and-a-half years since its approval by the U.S Food and Drug Administration in March 2017, opinions have been overwhelmingly favorable. However, some patients have reported side effects or have not benefitted as much as they had hoped. Paul Yamauchi, MD, PhD, a dermatologist in private practice in Santa Monica, California, estimates that between two-thirds and three-fourths of his patients with AD have done well on the drug. “Dupixent doesn’t totally clear the risk of future eczema outbreaks, but it succeeds in managing symptoms,” he said. “Most of my patients experience less itching, a reduction in the rash, better sleep and a better quality of life overall.”
But Dupixent isn’t a cure, and it’s not perfect."

It is also used along with other medications to prevent wheezing, shortness of breath, coughing, and chest tightness due to certain types of asthma in adults and children 6 years and older whose symptoms are not controlled with other medications. Dupilumab injection is also used along with other medications to treat chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (ongoing runny nose, sinus swelling and/or nasal congestion, with or without a reduced sense of smell or pain and pressure in the face) in adults whose symptoms are not controlled with other medications. Dupilumab injection is in a class of medications called monoclonal antibodies. It works by stopping the action of certain substances in the body that cause the symptoms of eczema.How should this medicine be used? Dupilumab injection comes as a prefilled syringe and a prefilled pen to inject subcutaneously (under the skin)."

It’s important to talk to your doctor about how AD affects not just your skin but also any other aspects of your life. Can I use Dupixent with steroids or other AD therapies? Dupixent has been studied for use with prescription topical steroids. Talk to your doctor about how to use Dupixent and what you should and shouldn’t do with regards to other therapies. The National Eczema Association is the driving force for an eczema community fueled by knowledge, strengthened through collective action and propelled by the promise for a better future."

Promisingly however, none of the physical and activity interventions assessed appeared to cause harm to the participants.Implications for practiceFor clinicians and people with chronic painThe evidence in this overview suggests that the broad spectrum of physical activity and exercise interventions assessed here (aerobic, strength, flexibility, range of motion, and core or balance training programmes, as well as yoga, Pilates, and tai chi) are potentially beneficial, though the evidence for benefit is low quality and inconsistent. The most commonly reported adverse events were increased soreness or muscle pain, which subsided after several weeks of the intervention.Physical activity and exercise may improve pain severity as well as physical function and quality of life.For policy makersThe evidence showed variable results, though in some reviews there was a clinical and statistical benefit in pain relief and physical function (based on low quality evidence). The evidence suggests that physical activity or exercise is an acceptable intervention in people with chronic pain, with minimal negative adverse effects. However based on this low quality evidence, we cannot provide direction to the content of an exercise programme should clinicians decide to implement one.Implications for researchThere is a clear need for further research into exercise and physical activity for chronic pain in adults.General implicationsFuture research should report baseline values for outcome measures in both intervention and control groups, together with detailed relevant information about the participants. Knowing the baseline value is relevant to interpreting any change observed as a result of the intervention, and understanding the broader value of the intervention.Where possible, pain results should be reported as the number of people achieving 50%, 30%, and 10% pain relief, and the number who did not meet that point (dichotomous outcome)."

However, the balance of evidence showed that yoga had no significant effect in improving pain, tender joints, swollen joints count, and inflammatory cytokines in patients suffering from RA. Considering methodological limitations, small sample size, and low-quality, we draw a very cautious conclusion in the results of the estimate of the effect. High-quality and large-scale RCTs are urgently needed in the future, and the real result may be substantially different. Introduction
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease, characterized by pain, stiffness, swelling, loss of joint function, and elevation of acute-phase reactant levels (1). This painful chronic condition not only impairs the quality of life but also one of the leading causes of deformities or disabilities (2)."

Many people with arthritis have joint stiffness that makes daily tasks difficult. Doing daily flexibility exercises helps maintain range of motion so you can keep doing everyday things like household tasks, hobbies, and visiting with friends and family. Balance exercises like walking backwards, standing on one foot, and tai chi are important for those who are at a risk of falling or have trouble walking. Do balance exercises 3 days per week if you are at risk of falling. Balance exercises are included in many group exercise classes."

Why is putting toothpaste on pimples so bad?“Toothpaste can be an extreme irritant,” says Dr. Gohara. “Most formulas are filled with ingredients like alcohol menthol, baking soda, and hydrogen peroxide—all things that, yes, can maybe dry out a zit, but at the risk of hardcore irritating your skin barrier at the same time.” And when your skin barrier is screwed up, “it goes into overdrive and overproduces oil to compensate, leading to clogged pores, breakouts, blackheads, and oily skin.” Fun, right?So even if you’re just putting a little dab on your zit, that gooey blob can spread around, quickly irritating the rest of your skin and potentially causing even more acne in the end. Plus, “drying out” your zit doesn’t really make it go away—it just dries out the top layer of your skin without killing the bacteria inside. All in all, a pretty bad solution.So how do you make pimples go away fast?If you’re dealing with cystic acne (the sore, swollen, under-the-skin bumps), you unfortunately can’t do much for them topically. A dab of over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream can help with the inflammation, but only a cortisone shot can get rid of them overnight, while prescription medication can fully heal them over time (so seriously, go to a derm).Otherwise, treat your zits by dabbing on a thin layer of a spot treatment after applying your moisturizer. For classic whiteheads, use a formula with benzoyl peroxide (it kills acne-causing bacteria), and for little clogged pores and inflamed bumps, try salicylic acid, which dissolves oil and skin cells."

AbstractHypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides > 150 mg/dL) affects ~25 % of the United States (US) population and is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 500 mg/dL) is also a risk factor for pancreatitis. Three omega-3 fatty acid (OM3FA) prescription formulations are approved in the US for the treatment of adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia: (1) OM3FA ethyl esters (OM3EE), a mixture of OM3FA ethyl esters, primarily eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (Lovaza®, Omtryg™, and generics); (2) icosapent ethyl (IPE), EPA ethyl esters (Vascepa®); and (3) omega-3 carboxylic acids (OM3CA), a mixture of OM3FAs in free fatty acid form, primarily EPA, DHA, and docosapentaenoic acid (Epanova®). At approved doses, all formulations substantially reduce triglyceride and very-low-density lipoprotein levels. DHA-containing formulations may also increase low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. However, this is not accompanied by increased non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, which is thought to provide a better indication of cardiovascular risk in this patient population."

Even though the previous version of our review showed benefits of probiotics for acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), several new studies have been published.Objectives: To assess the effectiveness and safety of probiotics (any specified strain or dose), compared with placebo, in the prevention of acute URTIs in people of all ages, at risk of acute URTIs.Search strategy: We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 6), MEDLINE (1950 to July week 3, 2014), EMBASE (1974 to July 2014), Web of Science (1900 to July 2014), the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, which includes the China Biological Medicine Database (from 1978 to July 2014), the Chinese Medicine Popular Science Literature Database (from 2000 to July 2014) and the Masters Degree Dissertation of Beijing Union Medical College Database (from 1981 to July 2014). We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov for completed and ongoing trials on 31 July 2014.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing probiotics with placebo to prevent acute URTIs.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility and quality of trials, and extracted data using the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.Main results: We included 13 RCTs, although we could only extract data to meta-analyse 12 trials, which involved 3720 participants including children, adults (aged around 40 years) and older people. We found that probiotics were better than placebo when measuring the number of participants experiencing episodes of acute URTI (at least one episode: odds ratio (OR) 0.53; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37 to 0.76, P value < 0.001, low quality evidence; at least three episodes: OR 0.53; 95% CI 0.36 to 0.80, P value = 0.002, low quality evidence); the mean duration of an episode of acute URTI (mean difference (MD) -1.89; 95% CI -2.03 to -1.75, P value < 0.001, low quality evidence); reduced antibiotic prescription rates for acute URTIs (OR 0.65; 95% CI 0.45 to 0.94, moderate quality evidence) and cold-related school absence (OR 0.10; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.47, very low quality evidence). Probiotics and placebo were similar when measuring the rate ratio of episodes of acute URTI (rate ratio 0.83; 95% CI 0.66 to 1.05, P value = 0.12, very low quality evidence) and adverse events (OR 0.88; 95% CI 0.65 to 1.19, P value = 0.40, low quality evidence).

Furthermore, the Kaplan–Meier statistic was used to estimate the level of protection of respiratory tract infection by administration of oropharyngeal probiotic over time. As shown in Figure 1, the Kaplan–Meier curve of probability not having any episodes of respiratory tract infections decreased gradually from 1 on the first day of this trial. Notably, the cumulative incidence of respiratory tract infection stopped increasing on day 10 in the probiotic group. This implicates that frontline medical staff in the probiotic group experienced sustained protection from respiratory tract infections after a certain time of oropharyngeal probiotic administration resulting in an extremely lower incidence rate of respiratory tract infections comparing with control group (p = 0.013).

Probiotic strain identity and host genetic differences may account for differential modulation of immune responses by probiotics. Current laboratory and clinical data regarding the possibility of the role of probiotics on preventing the development of respiratory tract infections are contradictory, and are somewhat insufficient to recommend strongly their routine use. Further study of gastrointestinal-respiratory interactions is likely to yield important insights into the pathogenesis of different pulmonary diseases, and improve our knowledge in the prophylactic role of probiotics in children affected by recurrent upper respiratory tract infections.SummaryA better understanding of the effects of different probiotic strains and a deeper insight into their mechanisms of action are needed for the validation of specific strains carrying a potential to modify the frequency and severity of RTIs in infants and children. No data have been collected in pediatric patients with chronic underlying diseases, and yet there are no published data concerning treatment of RTIs with probiotics. The very few studies published so far do not indicate which micro-organism or administration regimen might exert beneficial effects as a prevention tool of RTIs both in healthy children and in those with recurrent RTIs."

IntroductionThe evolution and emergence of viruses have significantly increased in the last two decades because of their rapid mutation. The emergence or re-emergence of viruses is attributable to several factors including increased numbers of immunocompromised patients, climate change, the absence of anti-viral agents, the increased geographical movement of people and goods, and genetic modification of viruses1,2.

Hoxsey claims that the internal formulation “stimulates the elimination of toxins that poison the system, thereby correcting the abnormal blood chemistry and normalizing cell metabolism.” His head nurse added that it restores acid/base balance, normal metabolism, and immune function, and “deals with the DNA.” None of these claims is substantiated by scientific data.

Harry denied his father’s medical history and claimed to his dying day that the AMA had fabricated a false death certificate and that his father had really died of an infection. In any case, the elder Hoxsey passed the cancer formula to Harry on his deathbed and warned him that “they will persecute you, slander you and try to drive you off the face of the earth.” A savior was born.

Hoxsey Therapy or Hoxsey Method is an alternative medical treatment promoted as a cure for cancer. The treatment consists of a caustic herbal paste for external cancers or an herbal mixture for ""internal"" cancers, combined with laxatives, douches, vitamin supplements, and dietary changes. Reviews by major medical bodies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society,[1] M. D. Anderson Cancer Center,[2] and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center,[3] have found no evidence that Hoxsey Therapy is an effective treatment for cancer. The sale or marketing of the Hoxsey Method was banned in the United States by the FDA on September 21, 1960 as a ""worthless and discredited"" remedy and a form of quackery. [4]
Currently, the Hoxsey Method is primarily marketed by the Bio-Medical Center in Tijuana, Mexico. Hoxsey Therapy is also marketed over the Internet; in June 2008, the FDA National Health Fraud Coordinator noted that ""There is no scientific evidence that it has any value to treat cancer, yet consumers can go online right now and find all sorts of false claims that Hoxsey treatment is effective against the disease."

Langer was so impressed after visiting Hoxsey in Dallas that he introduced a Senate resolution, calling for creation of a special subcommittee to hold hearings on Hoxsey's method and verify that it could cure cancer. After the AMA Journal criticized Hoxsey as a ""cancer charlatan"" in 1949, Hoxsey tried to silence the organization with a defamation suit. An elderly Texas judge ruled that Hoxsey's potions were ""reasonably comparable"" to medical treatments such as surgery and radiation, though he only awarded Hoxsey $2 in damages, according to historian Young. At that point, the FDA jumped into the fight."

While some fraudulent products claim to cure a variety of diseases and conditions, fraudulent cancer products often use a particular vocabulary, Kornspan says. Consumers should recognize certain phrases as red flags, including:
Treats all forms of cancer
Miraculously kills cancer cells and tumors
Shrinks malignant tumors
Selectively kills cancer cells
More effective than chemotherapy
Attacks cancer cells, leaving healthy cells intact
Cures cancer
Moreover, whether products claim to cure cancer or another disease, there are a number of catch phrases that can tip you off that they’re bogus. “There are legal ways for patients to access investigational drugs, for example taking part in clinical trials,” says Kornspan. Patients looking to try an experimental cancer treatment should talk to their doctor about treatment options. For more information, visit the National Cancer Institute Clinical Trials website.

And a review of nine studies published in November 2019 in Plant Foods for Human Nutrition found that getting 200 to 400 mg of L-theanine a day may help reduce stress and anxiety in people exposed to stressful conditions.How you use it: Brew yourself a cup of tea: Green, black, white, and oolong all contain L-theanine, albeit in varying amounts. You can also find the amino acid in capsules, liquids, and powders.MagnesiumLuca D'Addezio/iStockWhat it is: Magnesium is a mineral the body uses to regulate dozens of processes, from the functioning of nerves and muscles to the synthesizing of protein and bone.Benefits: So far, research points to magnesium as possibly being helpful in people who have mild anxiety. A review of 18 studies published in May 2017 in the journal Nutrients found that magnesium supplements may improve stress and anxiety but also noted that the quality of the evidence was poor and more research needs to be done before magnesium can be established as a stress reducer.How you use it: Magnesium is found in green leafy vegetables, nuts, seeds, legumes, whole grains, and some breakfast cereals and other fortified foods. That said, many of us aren’t getting enough, according to the National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS)."

So let's dive into the recently available research unveiling the “stress-reducing” effect of L-theanine in humans. L-theanine’s impact on stress and anxiety: Human studies
A recent 2016 systematic review looked at all available human clinical trials that examined the effects of supplemental L-theanine consumption (200-400 mg/day) on stress and anxiety. Of the five randomized controlled trials, four trials found that L-theanine was associated with reduced stress and anxiety in people experiencing stressful situations. [1] However, these studies only looked at those experiencing acute stress, and more research is needed to evaluate L-theanine’s impact on chronic stress. One randomized control trial showed particular promise for the future of L-theanine research."

The compound passes through the blood–brain barrier, so it could directly benefit brain plasticity — the process through which the brain regenerates itself. It could also act on the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis (the body’s stress response system), reducing cortisol and stress levels. Animal tests suggest that l-theanine also boosts the neurotransmitter GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid), which in turn reduces anxiety.The other major constituent of green tea, EGCG, also seems to contribute to the drink’s mental-health benefits. In a detailed study, Scholey used electroencephalography to compare the brain activity of people consuming either an EGCG-containing nutrient drink or a placebo."

Steam Inhalation Benefits for Cold and Sinus  

Many sufferers of upper respiratory infections, such as the common cold and sinusitis, have found steam inhalation helpful as a part of treatment. Generally speaking, therapy for these conditions centers on resting and drinking fluids while managing symptoms. While steam inhalation doesn’t kill viruses or bacteria, it may help as your body fights off the infection. While more research is needed on some of the purported benefits of this therapy, some studies—alongside anecdotal evidence—have found it to have clinical value.

Although not a cure for depression, exercise certainly plays a role in managing symptoms, along with psychotherapy and medication. A 2018 meta-analysis published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry found that resistance exercise (lifting weights) significantly reduced the symptoms of depression in adults.﻿﻿



More specifically, the study’s authors found that people with mild to moderate depression saw a significant reduction in symptoms when they performed resistance training two or more days a week, compared with people who did not lift weights. Participants also experienced a mood boost after working out. Another 2016 meta-analysis in the Journal of Psychiatric Research found that moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, when performed regularly, supports the claim that exercise can be an evidenced-based part of treatment for depression.﻿﻿ 


Finally, a 2018 study in Frontiers in Psychiatry showed that exercise resulted in a greater reduction in depression symptoms, greater improvements in sleep quality and cognitive function.﻿﻿



Of the participants, 75% showed either a therapeutic response or complete remission of symptoms compared to 25% who did not exercise."

Whereas, extant results suggest that exercise indeed reduces core symptoms of depression, such as depressed mood, anhedonia, and suicidal ideation (105, 106). On the other hand, studies examining the effects of exercise interventions on cognitive function among individuals with depression [e.g., 107] at present do not indicate substantial benefits (108–110). Exercise may be effective improving several biomarkers that have been implicated in depression (e.g., impaired neuroplasticity, autonomic, and immune imbalances). However, at present, evidence derived from non-depressed individuals still needs to be replicated among clinical populations (111). Nevertheless, recent trials have begun to show efficacy in treating patients with severe mood disorders (112–114) and individuals with treatment-resistant depression, either alone or as an add-on to medications (115, 116)."

If you do not see any obvious parts of the tick's head where it bit you, assume you have removed the entire tick, but watch for symptoms of a skin infection.

Improper tick removal may cause mouthparts to break off in the skin, possibly leading to infection or granuloma formation.7 Twisting off the head should be avoided, because this may cause the tick's potentially infectious body fluids to escape.Ticks should never be handled with bare hands and should be disposed of with hazardous waste or preserved in alcohol if identification is needed.Few methods for tick removal that have been reported in the literature have scientific support. Some methods that are not recommended (Table 1) include applying a hot match or nail to the tick body; covering the tick with petroleum jelly, nail polish, alcohol or gasoline; using injected or topical lidocaine (Xylocaine); or passing a suture needle through the tick.8–15 Although there is conflicting evidence as to whether the removal technique influences infection rates,6,10,16 these methods may induce the tick to salivate and regurgitate into the attachment site, theoretically increasing the risk of infection.8,11View/Print TableTABLE 1Ineffective or Dangerous Methods of Removing Ticks: What Not to DoDo not use sharp forceps.Do not crush, puncture, or squeeze the tick's body.Do not apply substances such as petroleum jelly, gasoline, lidocaine (Xylocaine), etc., to the tick.Do not apply heat with a match or hot nail.Do not use a twisting or jerking motion to remove the tick.Do not handle the tick with bare hands.TABLE 1Ineffective or Dangerous Methods of Removing Ticks: What Not to DoDo not use sharp forceps.Do not crush, puncture, or squeeze the tick's body.Do not apply substances such as petroleum jelly, gasoline, lidocaine (Xylocaine), etc., to the tick.Do not apply heat with a match or hot nail.Do not use a twisting or jerking motion to remove the tick.Do not handle the tick with bare hands.Commercially available tick-removal devices include the Sawyer Tick Pliers (B&A Products, Bunch, Okla.), Pro-Tick Remedy (SCS Limited, Stony Point, N.Y.) and Ticked Off (Ticked Off Inc., Dover, N.H.).

 Iron Deficiency AnemiaHow to Increase Your Iron Absorption and Manage Iron-Deficiency AnemiaRunning low on iron? What you eat — and when you eat it — could help boost your levels of this important mineral and fight the symptoms of anemia.By Stephanie SmithMedically Reviewed by Sanjai Sinha, MDReviewed: August 1, 2018Medically ReviewedA 3-ounce serving of oysters contains nearly 8 milligrams of iron.DepositphotosIf you’ve been diagnosed with iron-deficiency anemia, you may be relieved to learn what’s been causing your symptoms. Iron is an essential mineral that, in addition to helping maintain healthy hair, skin, and nails, aids in the production of hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that helps transport oxygen throughout the body. People who are deficient in iron (or who have iron-deficiency anemia) have trouble producing enough healthy red blood cells, which can cause fatigue, shortness of breath, and more.But don’t start piling your plate full of spinach, Popeye-style, just yet. Here’s what to know about iron-deficiency anemia and how to boost your iron levels.Treat What’s Causing Your Iron-Deficiency AnemiaKnowing the reason why you’re deficient in iron is an important first step in controlling your condition, says Sioban Keel, MD, a hematologist and an associate professor of hematology at the University of Washington School of Medicine. For example, women who have heavy periods are particularly at risk for the condition, according to the American Society of Hematologists (ASH); some women may need to take an iron supplement or talk to their gynecologist about birth control options that could lessen the bleeding, Dr. Keel says.Or, says Cristina Sutter, MHSc, RD, from Vancouver, Canada, “if you’re an athlete, and you’re losing extra iron through sweat, or a vegetarian who’s short on [iron], just being aware [of your low iron] and remembering to take your supplement and eat a well-balanced diet can make all the difference.”Eat Smart to Increase Your Iron AbsorptionWhat you eat — and when you eat it — can impact iron absorption."

Red meat, pork and poultry
Seafood
Beans
Dark green leafy vegetables, such as spinach
Dried fruit, such as raisins and apricots
Iron-fortified cereals, breads and pastas
Peas

Your body absorbs more iron from meat than it does from other sources. If you choose to not eat meat, you may need to increase your intake of iron-rich, plant-based foods to absorb the same amount of iron as does someone who eats meat. Choose foods containing vitamin C to enhance iron absorptionYou can enhance your body's absorption of iron by drinking citrus juice or eating other foods rich in vitamin C at the same time that you eat high-iron foods."

Red meat, pork and poultry
Seafood
Beans
Dark green leafy vegetables, such as spinach
Dried fruit, such as raisins and apricots
Iron-fortified cereals, breads and pastas
Peas

Your body absorbs more iron from meat than it does from other sources. If you choose to not eat meat, you may need to increase your intake of iron-rich, plant-based foods to absorb the same amount of iron as does someone who eats meat. Choose foods containing vitamin C to enhance iron absorptionYou can enhance your body's absorption of iron by drinking citrus juice or eating other foods rich in vitamin C at the same time that you eat high-iron foods."

Copper bracelets: Evidence and benefits for arthritis

Medical News TodayNewsletterDo copper bracelets help with arthritis?Medically reviewed by Debra Rose Wilson, Ph.D., MSN, R.N., IBCLC, AHN-BC, CHT — Written by Markus MacGill on June 27, 2018EvidencePain reliefWhat people sayMedicine for arthritis painCopper bracelets are thought to help ease the aches and pains of stiff and sore joints. The as-yet limited research has yielded some evidence to support their use in medicine, but even more studies have emerged advising that they have no clinical impact.Proponents of the treatment suggest that the skin absorbs tiny particles of copper. This is then said to help reduce inflammation in the joints, as copper is a vital nutrient that serves this purpose in the body.However, evidence supporting copper bracelets as a treatment is extremely thin on the ground.This article will examine the research into any pain-relieving properties of copper bracelets and explain why people buy copper wristbands for health reasons.EvidenceResearchers give a short but thorough answer to the question of copper bracelets providing inflammation relief:There is no good evidence that they reduce pain or inflammation.There is strong evidence that they do not have any clinical effect.A 2013 study that reached such conclusions compared different copper and magnetic bracelets used by people with rheumatoid arthritis.If there had been even a minimal clinical improvement of even 20 percent in pain ratings, the study would have found it, but there was no improvement whatsoever.Dr. Stewart Richmond, who also led the 2013 study from the Department of Health Sciences at the University of York in the UK, wrote in the published paper for magnetic bracelets:“The results of this trial, which compared strong versus weak magnets strapped to the knee, showed that there was no statistical difference in pain outcomes between experimental and control groups.”But he goes on to say that “people who suffer with rheumatoid arthritis may be better off saving their money, or spending it on other complementary interventions, such as dietary fish oils, for example, which have far better evidence for effectiveness.”This study is also the basis for the Arthritis Foundation’s advice against using copper bracelets as a treatment for arthritic inflammation.Which symptoms were measured in the 2013 Richmond trial?Share on PinterestCopper bracelets are said to have a pain-reducing effect on arthritis symptoms. However, reliable studies have refuted this.Joints were assessed for pain and disability. An effort was made to ensure neither the doctor nor the patient could determine the type of the bracelet being worn.If one of the types of bracelet in the trial could produce a minimum 20 percent improvement in tender and swollen joints, the bracelets will have been considered a meaningful indicator of clinical effectiveness.Whatever the findings, the trial design meant that the conclusion would be reported with a fair level of certainty.These associations can be reinforced further by the natural course of chronic pain conditions."

Placebo-controlled trials have been done in both osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A few small studies showed that magnets may offer some pain benefit in osteoarthritis, but these results have not been replicated or expanded to larger trials. “In my research I set out to confuse the heck out of participants so they couldn't tell which device was real and which was a placebo,” says one researcher, Stewart Richmond, PhD, research fellow at the University of York, in England."

        Can Copper Bracelets Help with Arthritis? Diseases, such as arthritis, which have no known cure often drive sufferers to what orthodox science might call ""questionable treatments."" The wearing of copper bracelets to ease the symptoms of arthritis is a case in point. This practice does indeed sound nonsensical; after all, how could wearing a bracelet affect the inner workings of the body? Well, perhaps if some of the copper dissolved in sweat and was absorbed into the body, one could make a case, albeit probably a feeble one. Joe Schwarcz PhD | 20 Mar 2017            You Asked

Wearing a copper ring or bracelet is very simple and inexpensive way to ward off potential threatening medical conditions.

Athlete's foot can usually be treated with non-prescription medication applied to the skin. The treatment for ringworm depends on its location on the body and how serious the infection is. Some forms of ringworm can be treated with non-prescription (“over-the-counter”) medications, but other forms of ringworm need treatment with prescription antifungal medication. Ringworm on the skin like athlete’s foot (tinea pedis) and jock itch (tinea cruris) can usually be treated with non-prescription antifungal creams, lotions, or powders applied to the skin for 2 to 4 weeks."

Over-the-counter antifungal creams are sufficient for treating most cases of athlete's foot. Apply them as directed to the toes and foot. Common brands include clotrimazole (Lotrimin) and terbinafine (Lamasil).If the topical antifungal medications do not clear up the infection, your doctor may prescribe an oral antifungal medication.If you are unsure of your diagnosis and/or you plan to visit a physician within the next month, the application of 1% hydrocortisone cream purchased over the counter would be a reasonable therapeutic tactic. Since many of the causes of foot dermatosis are not infections, they may respond to this medication. Moreover, it will enhance your doctor's ability to find fungal organisms should they be the cause."

Moisturizing the skinCocoa butter is a core ingredient in many skin moisturizers. Some people use pure cocoa butter to help relieve dry skin.Like other natural moisturizers, such as coconut oil, cocoa butter is mostly made up of fatty acids. These fats may help form a protective layer on the skin, preventing moisture from escaping, and therefore stopping the skin from drying out.Some people also use cocoa butter to relieve skin dryness from common skin conditions, such as eczema and psoriasis. While this works for some people, there is no scientific evidence that it will work for everyone.3. Preventing stretch marksMany people believe that cocoa butter can prevent stretch marks from developing, especially during pregnancy.Some doctors and midwives may advise the use of cocoa butter during pregnancy to reduce the risk of stretch marks, but there is no evidence that using cocoa butter will achieve this.One review reports that several studies failed to find any evidence that cocoa butter prevents stretch marks during pregnancy."

The cause of the problem is unknown, but many women believe that rubbing cocoa butter on the skin can help prevent the marks.Although scientific evidence supporting the use of cocoa butter is lacking, many physicians and midwives continue to recommend it.In the present study, Dr. A. H Nassar and colleagues sought to settle this issue by examining the stretch marks that arose in 210 pregnant women who were randomly assigned to apply cocoa butter or inactive “placebo” to their abdomen, breasts, and thighs once daily starting during the first trimester of pregnancy.Eighty-three percent of women completed the study, Nassar, from the American University of Beirut Medical Center in Lebanon and colleagues note.Overall, 45 percent of cocoa butter-treated women developed stretch marks compared with 49 percent of women given placebo lotion. Although the percentage is slightly lower in the cocoa butter group, from a statistical standpoint, the difference was not considered significant, meaning that it may have simply arisen by chance.There was also no difference between the groups in the severity of their stretch marks.“Our findings do not support the use of cocoa butter lotion for the prevention of striae gravidarum,” Nassar and colleagues conclude. Further studies, they say, are needed to confirm their findings in other populations and to evaluate the effectiveness of other commonly used products in preventing stretch marks.SOURCE: BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology, August 2008.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.AppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Probiotics for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in children 

What is antibiotic-associated diarrhea?Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) occurs when antibiotics disturb the natural balance of ""good"" and ""bad"" bacteria in the intestinal tract causing harmful bacteria to multiply beyond their normal numbers. The symptoms of AAD include frequent watery bowel movements and crampy abdominal pain.What are probiotics?Probiotics are found in dietary supplements or yogurts and contain potentially beneficial bacteria or yeast. Probiotics may restore the natural balance of bacteria in the intestinal tract.What did the researchers investigate?The researchers investigated whether probiotics prevent AAD in children receiving antibiotic therapy and whether probiotics causes any harms (side effects)."
Can probiotics prevent diarrhea caused by antibiotics in children?,2,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/probiotics-for-diarrhea,0.606408302982648,0.538172756632169,-0.011810968630016,"Treatment includes preventing dehydration, reducing the time that a person is infectious, and shortening the duration of diarrhea.One review of 63 studies in 8,014 people concluded that probiotics safely reduced the duration of diarrhea and stool frequency in adults and children with infectious diarrhea (5).On average, the groups treated with probiotics experienced diarrhea for nearly 25 hours less than the control groups (5).Antibiotic-associated diarrheaAntibiotics are medications used to treat an array of illnesses caused by bacteria. Diarrhea is a common side effect of antibiotic treatment due to the disruption of normal gut microbiota these medications cause.Taking probiotics may help prevent diarrhea associated with antibiotic use by repopulating beneficial bacteria in the gut.A review of 17 studies in 3,631 people demonstrated that antibiotic-associated diarrhea was significantly more prevalent in those who were not supplementing with probiotics. In fact, nearly 18% of people in the control groups had antibiotic-associated diarrhea while only 8% of people in groups treated with probiotics were affected (6).The review concluded that probiotics — particularly Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Saccharomyces boulardii species— may reduce the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea by up to 51% (6).Traveler’s diarrheaTraveling exposes you to many types of microorganisms that are not typically introduced to your system, which can cause diarrhea. Traveler’s diarrhea is defined as “the passage of three or more unformed stools per day” with at least one related symptom, such as cramps or abdominal pain, occurring in a traveler after arrival to their destination. It impacts 20 million people annually (7, 8).A review of 11 studies found that preventative treatment with probiotic supplements significantly reduced the occurrence of traveler’s diarrhea (9).Another 2019 review of 12 studies showed that only treatment with the probiotic Saccharomyces boulardii resulted in significant reductions of up to 21% in traveler’s diarrhea (8).Diarrhea impacting children and infants Antibiotic-associated diarrhea and diseases that cause diarrhea are prevalent in infants and children. Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a disease of the intestines that occurs almost exclusively in infants."

Probiotics can be beneficial for both adults and kids. If your child has an illness that requires an antibiotic medication for treatment, taking a probiotic can help shorten symptoms. Probiotics can also be used to help relieve constipation, acid reflux, diarrhea, gas and eczema in children. Introducing probiotics into your child’s diet through food is typically a safe way to give them probiotics. Foods like yogurt and cottage cheese are often part of a balanced diet and can add in good bacteria without much risk."

It’s uncertain whether probiotics actually don’t work in elderly people or whether no effect was seen because there were only a few studies of people in this age group. A review of 23 studies (with 3,938 participants) of probiotics to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea in children provided moderate quality evidence that probiotics had a protective effect. No serious side effects were observed in children who were otherwise healthy, except for the infection for which they were being treated. Clostridium difficile Infection
The bacterium Clostridium difficile can infect the colon (large intestine) of patients who have received antibiotics, causing diarrhea that can range from mild to severe. C. difficile infection is difficult to treat and sometimes comes back after treatment."

For years, doctors recommended acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) for OA. But recent studies suggest that acetaminophen does little for OA pain. The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and Arthritis Foundation (AF) treatment guidelines released in 2020 don’t recommend it unless you can’t use NSAIDs. But it may help OA pain for some people. Acetaminophen can harm your liver, so never take more than prescribed and only use it as needed."

Most studies lasted on average about 6 weeks.What is osteoarthritis and what drugs are used to treat it? Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis that can affect the hands, hips, shoulders and knees. In OA, the cartilage that protects the ends of the bones breaks down and causes pain and swelling. There are two main types of drug treatments in OA: acetaminophen which is used to relieve pain but does not affect swelling; and NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, diclofenac and cox IIs (celecoxib), which are used to decrease pain and swelling. It is not clear which type is best to use or which causes more side effects: high doses of acetaminophen may cause stomach problems, such as ulcers, and NSAIDs may cause stomach, kidney or heart problems."

NSAIDs have a higher ES than paracetamol for pain relief and in addition help other symptoms of OA such as stiffness. However, weighed against this relative difference in efficacy is the excellent safety record of paracetamol. The selection of treatments depends on a balance of factors, of which efficacy is just one. Other factors include safety, tolerability, availability, cost, and patient acceptance.4,54 However, given its favourable safety profile within the treatment dose of up to 4 g a day, this largest meta-analysis of paracetamol confirms significant efficacy for pain relief in OA. It therefore supports the recommendation that paracetamol be considered the first line oral analgesic in the management of OA.4,5

These results are consistent with the findings of recent reports concerning omega-3 fatty acids as an effective adjunctive treatment for bipolar disorder (3) and recurrent depression (4). However, the results of the current study extend these findings by suggesting that omega-3 fatty acids may be an effective form of monotherapy for women with moderately severe cases of borderline personality disorder.The main limitations of this study are that only women were studied and all subjects were moderately ill. Whether similar results would be found for male subjects or subjects with a more severe symptom picture is unknown.Studies assessing different doses of E-EPA for longer periods of time in larger samples are needed.TABLE 1Enlarge tableReceived April 3, 2002; revision received Aug. 8, 2002; accepted Sept. 5, 2002.

Omega-3s have been studied in various mood disorders, such as postpartum depression, with some promising results. In bipolar disorder (manic depression), the omega-3s may be most effective for the depressed phase rather than the manic phase of the illness. The omega-3s have also been proposed to alleviate or prevent other psychiatric conditions including schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and attention deficit disorder. However, there is still not enough evidence to recommend the omega-3s in these conditions. What dose of omega-3s is beneficial? Doses for depression range from less than 1 g/day to 10 g/day, but most studies use doses between 1 and 2 g/day."

This sample was small and only included women, which means the results can not be generalized to an entire population. However, it does begin painting a picture of how omega-3 may benefit borderline patients. Omega-3 is used to treat symptoms, not a particular disease. This can be both positive and negative in mental health care.. By only treating symptoms, omega-3 is not targeting the root causes of a disease and therefore cannot be a cure.

The interaction between vitamin D and the pathogenesis of asthma is complex, but the known mechanisms raise the potential for vitamin D repletion as adjunct therapy which include: effects on lung development (structural effects), VDD could alter lung structure and create deficits in lung function thus leading to permanent susceptibility to poorer respiratory outcomes; anti-inflammatory effects, vitamin D could inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and vitamin D receptor (VDR) could suppress NF-κB activation and signaling; immunomodulation, addition of vitamin D to human monocytes could inhibits the expression of the toll-like receptors 2 and 4 resulting in reduced production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), but the role of vitamin D on Th2 cells is not consistent; airway smooth muscle (ASM) modulation, ASM cells possess the enzymatic machinery to form 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D from 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D could in turn suppress ASM proliferation and decrease expression of inflammatory chemokines; altering the effect of anti-asthmatic therapy, VDD may lead to down-regulation of corticosteroids pathways and vitamin D could improve corticosteroids response by increasing mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MKP-1), which is a protein involved in directing cellular responses to a diverse array of stimuli. However, the consequences from human studies were inconsistent with some demonstrating benefit from increased vitamin D intake, while others suggesting inferior asthmatic outcomes associated with higher vitamin D, thus activating our interests in further evaluating the effects of vitamin D supplementation in patients with asthma.Poorly controlled airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness are pathological and clinical hallmarks underlying asthma exacerbations, which can be induced and enhanced by interleukins (ILs) released by Th lymphocytes via activation of arginase activity.17,18 Zhang et al found that the production of IL-6 and TNF-α could be suppressed by vitamin D via the inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase in monocytes,19 and several studies have also shown that higher levels of IL-17A and IL-22 were synthesized in asthmatic patients which could not be inhibited by glucocorticoids but vitamin D could significantly reduce both.20,21 However, our pooled data analysis showed that treatment of vitamin D did not significantly decrease asthma exacerbations, which we supposed to be caused by the multiple factors associated with development of exacerbations, such as indoor and outdoor allergens, pollutants, specific drugs, poorly adherent to asthma controllers, as well as viral infections. Martineau et al14 conducted a trial to evaluate the effect of vitamin D on upper respiratory infections in 250 patients with asthma, but the results showed no influence (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.87, 95% CI: 0.64–1.16, P = 0.34)."

High quality evidence suggests Vitamin D can reduce asthma attacks 

A new Cochrane Review published in the Cochrane Library has found evidence from randomized trials that taking an oral vitamin D supplement in addition to standard asthma medication is likely to reduce severe asthma attacks.Scroll to the bottom of this article for a round-up of media coverageAsthma is a common chronic disease, affecting about 300 million people worldwide. The symptoms of asthma include wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath.Low blood levels of vitamin D have been linked to increased risk of asthma attacks in children and adults with asthma. There has been a growing interest in the potential role of vitamin D in asthma management, because it might help to reduce upper respiratory infections (such as the common cold) that can lead to exacerbations of asthma. Several clinical trials have tested whether taking vitamin D as a supplement has an effect on asthma attacks, symptoms, and lung function in children and adults with asthma.The team of Cochrane researchers found seven trials involving 435 children and two studies, involving 658 adults.

High quality evidence suggests Vitamin D can reduce asthma attacks 

A new Cochrane Review published in the Cochrane Library has found evidence from randomized trials that taking an oral vitamin D supplement in addition to standard asthma medication is likely to reduce severe asthma attacks.Scroll to the bottom of this article for a round-up of media coverageAsthma is a common chronic disease, affecting about 300 million people worldwide. The symptoms of asthma include wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath.Low blood levels of vitamin D have been linked to increased risk of asthma attacks in children and adults with asthma. There has been a growing interest in the potential role of vitamin D in asthma management, because it might help to reduce upper respiratory infections (such as the common cold) that can lead to exacerbations of asthma. Several clinical trials have tested whether taking vitamin D as a supplement has an effect on asthma attacks, symptoms, and lung function in children and adults with asthma.The team of Cochrane researchers found seven trials involving 435 children and two studies, involving 658 adults. The study participants were ethnically diverse, reflecting the broad range of global geographic settings, involving Canada, India, Japan, Poland, the UK, and the US. The majority of people recruited to the studies had mild to moderate asthma, and a minority had severe asthma."

Vitamin D supplementation in addition to asthma controllers cannot decrease asthma exacerbation and FeNO, nor improve lung function and asthma symptoms, although it can be safely applied to increase serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels.

          Background:
        
      
      The relationship between asthma and vitamin D deficiency has been known for some time. However, interventional studies conducted in this regard have shown conflicting results. Objective:
        
      
      To evaluate the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in asthmatic patients in improving the degree of control of asthma. Methods:
        
      
      Randomised, triple-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in adult asthmatic patients with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin-D3 <30 ng/mL. The intervention group received oral supplementation with 16 000 IU of calcifediol per week, and the control group had placebo added to their usual asthma treatment. The study period was 6 months."

They may also not be the best choice for infants with cow’s milk allergy or intolerance. The bottom lineSoy formula is likely safe for most healthy babies. It’s just as nutritious as other types of formula and likely the most beneficial choice for vegan families and babies with galactosemia or hereditary lactase deficiency.Against popular belief, the evidence doesn’t support the claim that soy formula prevents colic or allergies or helps protect from disease later in life. Moreover, soy formula is not an appropriate choice for babies born prematurely, nor those with low birth weights, poor renal function, or a cow’s milk allergy.When in doubt, make sure to consult a qualified healthcare provider to determine which baby formula is most appropriate for your baby.

Also significant was the percentage of subjects who lost between 5 and 10 % of body weight after 90 days compared to placebo group (32.4 and 3.3 %, respectively). Although some studies demonstrated that reduction in body weight by administration of chitosan can be achieved in individuals given a hypocaloric or standardized diet [14, 29], other studies show efficacy of chitosan for persons without diet restrictions [10, 23, 30, 31]. The results of our study confirm that indeed significant weight loss can be achieved in subjects adhering to a non-restrictive diet [10, 23, 30, 31]. Reasons for the difference in results in our study with other reported studies could be difference in diets, dosage and timing of chitosan administration or protocol variability such as life style recommendations.One factor which is important to consider is the timing of chitosan ingestion before meals. It is typically recommended that chitosan supplements be ingested approximately 15 min to 1 h prior to a meal in order to allow sufficient time for chitosan to dissolve in the stomach acid[18]."

Hip pain in adults






Most cases of hip pain in adults that are treated with surgery are caused by osteoarthritis, the most common type of arthritis in the UK.This page aims to give you a better idea of whether osteoarthritis or something more unusual is causing your hip pain, and what you can do about it.But do not try to diagnose the cause of your hip pain yourself. This should always be a matter for your doctor.Find out more about hip pain in children


OsteoarthritisThe symptoms of osteoarthritis can vary greatly from person to person, but if it affects the hip, it'll typically cause:mild inflammation of the tissues in and around the hip jointdamage to cartilage, the strong, flexible tissue that lines the bonesbony growths (osteophytes) that develop around the edge of the hip jointThis can lead to pain, stiffness and difficulty doing certain activities.There's no cure for osteoarthritis, but the symptoms can be eased using a number of different treatments. Surgery is not usually needed.Find out more about treating osteoarthritis


Less common causesLess commonly, hip pain may be caused by:the bones of the hip rubbing together because they're abnormally shaped (femoroacetabular impingement)a tear in the ring of cartilage surrounding the socket of the hip joint (a hip labral tear)the hip joint is the wrong shape or the hip socket is not in the correct position to completely cover and support the top of the leg bone (hip dysplasia)a hip fracture – this will cause sudden hip pain and is more common in older people with weaker bonesan infection in the bone or joint, such as septic arthritis or osteomyelitis – see a GP immediately if you have hip pain and feverreduced blood flow to the hip joint, causing the bone to break down (osteonecrosis)inflammation and swelling of the fluid-filled sac (bursa) over your hip joint (bursitis)a hamstring injuryan inflamed ligament in the thigh, often caused by too much running – this is known as iliotibial band syndrome and is treated with rest (read more about sprains and strains)


When to get medical adviceHip pain often gets better on its own and can be managed with rest and painkillers you can buy from a pharmacy, such as paracetamol and ibuprofen. But see a GP if:your hip is still painful after 1 week of resting it at homeyou also have a fever or rashyour hip pain came on suddenly and you have sickle cell anaemiathe pain is in both hips and other joints as wellYour GP may ask you the following questions:Where do you feel the pain?When and how did the pain start?Does anything make the pain worse?Does anything make the pain better?Can you walk and bear weight on it?Do you have any other medical problems?Do you take any medicines?Go straight to hospital if:the hip pain was caused by a serious fall or accidentyour leg is deformed, badly bruised or bleedingyou're unable to move your hip or bear any weight on your legyou have hip pain with a temperature and feel unwell


Managing hip pain at homeIf you do not need to see a doctor straight away, consider managing and monitoring the problem at home.You may find it helpful to:lose weight if you're overweight to relieve some of the strain on your hipavoid activities that make the pain worse, such as downhill runningwear flat shoes and avoid standing for long periodssee a physiotherapist for some muscle-strengthening exercisestake painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen


OveractivityIf your hip pain is related to exercising or other types of regular activity:cut down on the amount of exercise you do if it's too muchalways warm up before exercising and stretch after exercisingtry low-impact exercises, such as swimming or cycling, instead of runningrun on a smooth, soft surface, such as grass, rather than on concretemake sure your running shoes fit well and support your feet properly

A study of 232 women showed that higher folate intake was associated with higher rates of implantation, clinical pregnancy, and live birth. The jury is still out on how much antioxidants will or won’t affect fertility, but there’s evidence pointing to the potential. Foods such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, and grains are packed full of beneficial antioxidants like vitamins C and E, folate, beta carotene, and lutein. Eating more of these healthy foods shouldn’t hurt in the effort.2. Eat a bigger breakfastEating a substantial breakfast may help women with fertility problems."

Acetyl L-carnitineWho it’s for: Men and womenClaimed fertility benefit: Helps sperm motility; contains antioxidants that promote healthy female reproductive systemWhen you think “vitamins,” acetyl L-carnitine (ALC) may not be the first to spring to mind. But that doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be on your radar. This supplement is a form of the amino acid L-carnitine (LC), which naturally occurs in the body and helps turn fat into energy.Sometimes ALC and LC are taken in combination to promote fertility in women. A 2018 review found that, though LC has some benefits for female fertility, ALC has more powerful antioxidants."

The study enrolled 171 couples where the male partner had at least one abnormal reading on an analysis evaluating sperm concentration, mobility, shape and DNA quality; the female partners had normal fertility test results. Men received a placebo or an antioxidant supplement containing vitamins C, E and D, selenium, l-carnitine, zinc, folic acid and lycopene for at least three months and up to six months.
